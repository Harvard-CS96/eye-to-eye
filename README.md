# Getting Started

Before running, please ensure that you have a `.env` file in the root directory in the format `KEY=VALUE`, one per line. `.env` should contain the following keys:

* DB_URI: an complete MongoDB connection URI
* FB_ID: a valid Facebook Developer App ID
* FB_SECRET: a valid Facebook Developer App Secret
* FB_CALLBACK: by default, `http://localhost:3000/auth/facebook/callback`; you should change the host and port of `FB_CALLBACK` according to the deployment configuration.

Then, run `npm install`. Finally, run `npm start`.

To run on a port other than `3000`, chaneg the `PORT` and `FB_CALLBACK`environment variables as well as the configuration in Facebook Developer.

# Technical Documentation

## Technical Overview

Eye to Eye is powered by a *node.js + express* backend. Pages are rendered server-side using the *Handlebars* templating engine. *Socket.io*, a wrapper around the *WebSocket* protocol, is used for bidirectional communication between server and client. The client side uses *Bootstrap* and *jQuery* for styling and interactivity and, following a handshake using *Socket.io*, clients initiate video chat using *WebRTC*, facilitated by *SimpleWebRTC* and *Xirsys* STUN servers. *tracking.js* is additionally used during video chat for facial masking. Data is stored using *MongoDB*.

Eye to Eye's main exectuable is `/server.js`, which:
* loads configurations from `/config` and `/.env`
* connects to MongoDB with *mongoose* and models in `/db`
* configures an *express* app using routing logic in `/routes` powered by logic in `/controllers` and rendering views in `/views`
* instantiates the matcher engine in `/matcher.js`
* initializes WebSocket communication from `/sockets.js`
* serves static resources from `/static`

Finally, in auto-deployment, shell scripts in `/scripts` are used to start/restart/stop the server using *nginx* and *pm2*.

## Configuration

The npm packages *dotenv* and *getconfig* are used for configuration. *getconfig* uses JSON to store configuration in `/config/default.json`  and *dotenv* uses key-value pairs stored in `/.env`. 

Data stored in `/config/default.json` is inevitably passed to the client side and is thus not secret, meaning that it can be safely committed. Data stored in `/.env` is not committed (and blacklisted by `/.gitignore`) because it contains sensitive API keys.

To load this configuration, the following code is run in `/server.js`:

```
require('dotenv').config();
var config = require('getconfig');
```

This stores the environment variables in `/.env` in `process.env` and the JSON in `/config/default.json` into the variable `config`.

## Database

The server connects to MongoDB by requiring `/db/connect.js`, which initializes a connection to the instance the `DB_URI` from `/.env`. `/db/connect.js` also exports models from `/db/models/`.

## Routes

Most routes are contained in `/routes/main.js`. Routes often use  the `isLoggedIn` function to ensure that users are authenticated and redirecting them to `/` otherwise. Authentication is powered by *passport.js* and relevant data is stored in `req.user` after successful authentication.

Routes that render *Handlebars* views in `/views` pass the data returned by the `getAuthInfo` function to the frontend, which allows the frontend to access user account data. API routes are powered by controllers in `/controllers`.

Note in particular that there is no route for modifying active questions. In the current implementation, questions are manually modified in the database. 

## Views

Views are contained in `/views` and are powered by Handlebars. Similar to PHP, Handlebars is a superset of HTML syntax that allows accessing JSON-formatted variables with `{{{variable}}}`. All views begin with the `/views/layouts/main.handlebars` layout and may utilize the partial views in `/views/partials`. HTML elements in views generally are styled using *Bootstrap* classes, while *jQuery* is used for interactivity. The view */views/video.handlebars* extensively utilizes *Socket.io* and *SimpleWebRTC* to communicate with the server for pairing and disconnection. 

During video chat, *SimpleWebRTC* uses an existing *<video>* tag to display local video and any specified element as a container to render remote video. Then, *tracking.js* and a *<canvas>* element are used such that either only a face with an obscured background or the text "No face found" are displayed. Further logic is used to make that effect more performant and robust to frame drops in the facial tracking.

## Controllers

Controllers reside in `/controllers` and work closely with models in `/db/models`. They are used to save information about conversations and users' stances as well as load data about users for matching purposes.

## Matcher

The matching engine is powered by `/matcher.js`. The matcher is completely modular from the server-side routing so that it can be separately tested. Currently, the matcher utilizes a dictionary, one entry per user, to match users and store their connection status (single or paired) in real time. In the future, the matcher may utilize a real-time in-memory database such as *Redis* for scale.

The `Matcher` class exposed by `/matcher.js` accepts new users when they `connect()` to the matcher. Each time a new user `connect`s, the matcher iterates over all users until a suitable match is found, or it is determined that no user can be matched to this user. When users `hangup` (either that user or their partner voluntarily ends the conversation), they are marked as single once again and a search for matches begins again. When a user is `disconnect`ed, is are removed from the dictionary of active users and a match search begins for its former partner. A blacklist ensures that users are not matched with their last `maxBlacklist` matches, where `maxBlacklist` is by default 1 but can be set to any number in the constructor call to `Matcher`. Finally, `addCallback` allows attaching callbacks to whenever a user changes state between `WAITING`, `PAIRING`, and `DISCONNECTED`; this is used to communicate to that user over `WebSocket`.

## Socket Logic

The server communicates over *WebSocket* using *Socket.io* routes in `/sockets.js`. Routes in this file are used initially to communicate to the matching engine to facilitate matching users who are online and waiting to find a video chat partner. After the matching engine has paired users, the other routes in this file are used to generate a unique room ID for those users to join, sending credentials for the STUN servers as well as a room ID.

`/socket.js` exports a function that accepts an node HTTP server, an initialized `Socket.io` server attached to an HTTP server, a `Matcher` from `/matcher.js`, and a `config` object loaded from `getconfig`. Because we use the `express-socket.io-session` package, we can use the `socket.handshake.session` variable to access persistable session data individual to each socket. 

## Static Assets

Images and CSS are stored in `/static/img` and `/static/css`. `/static/js` contains the *SimpleWebRTC* and *tracking.js* libraries as well as a face-detection plugin for *tracking.js*. Complex AJAX requests for transmitting user opinions and post-conversation feedback are powered by `/static/js/stances.js` and `/static/js/feedback.js`, respectively.
